# Leads_Scoring_Case_Study


X Education, an online education company catering to industry professionals, experiences a significant influx of potential customers visiting their website daily. These professionals explore various courses offered by the company, initiated through marketing efforts on multiple platforms, including websites and search engines like Google.

Upon landing on the website, these individuals may engage further by browsing courses, filling out course forms, or watching instructional videos. Those who provide contact details, such as email addresses or phone numbers, are categorized as leads. Additionally, the company acquires leads through referrals. Following lead acquisition, the sales team initiates communication through calls, emails, etc., resulting in the conversion of some leads while others remain unconverted. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education stands at approximately 30%.

Despite a considerable number of acquired leads, the lead conversion rate is deemed insufficient. For instance, out of 100 acquired leads, only around 30 are converted. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads.' Successfully identifying this subset of leads is expected to increase the lead conversion rate, as the sales team can prioritize communication with potential leads rather than reaching out indiscriminately to everyone.

The project's objective is to develop a classification model employing algorithms like logistic regression to accurately predict potential leads for X Education, thereby optimizing the lead conversion process.
